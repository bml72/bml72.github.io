        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            This website goes over COVID-19 infection and vaccination data for all countries across the world. 
            The purpose of this particular webpage is to provide an overview of the project and contains no 
            visualizations. Please see the "Infections" and "Vaccinations" links in the navigation bar above 
            for visualizations and analyses on the respective topics. 
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Since its inception in late 2019, COVID-19 has devastated the world with over 148 million cases and 
            3 million deaths. However, the introduction of different vaccines in early 2021 has sparked hope for 
            many. Vaccines developed by Pfizer, Moderna, BioNTech, Sputnik V, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & 
            Johnson are being distributed in countries across the world. The return to pre-pandemic life may come 
            sooner than expected.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This project attempts to apply visualizations to understand what demographic and health-related 
            factors influence COVID-19 infection and vaccination rates, as well as which countries are on track 
            to gain full population immunity the quickest. The following variables are considered in this project:

            Visualizations on infection data attempt to show which countries have suffered the most from COVID-19, 
            and what factors may have led to their suffering. "Suffering" is defined by the number of total cases 
            and deaths from COVID. Visualizations on vaccination data attempt to show which countries are on track 
            to gain full population immunity first, and what factors may play a part in vaccination progress. 
            Exploration into infections can be found on the <a id='link' href='infections.html'>infections</a> webpage, 
            while exploration into vaccinations can be found on the <a id='link' href='vaccinations.html'>vaccinations</a>
            webpage.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Pre-Processing</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The infections data was downloaded from the Our World in Data <a id='link' href='https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data' target='_blank'>website</a>, while the 
            vaccination data was downloaded from <a id='link' href='https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress' target='_blank'>Kaggle</a>.
            The CSV files were pre-processed using Python (see <a id='link' href='py/preprocessing.py' taret='_blank'>preprocessing.py</a>). Below are 
            some of the basic steps taken to clean the data.
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>All countries that appear on the infections dataset and not the vaccinations dataset (and vice versa) were removed. By analyzing data for a 
                    country that doesn't exist on one of the two datasets, we can't gain full insight into how that country was affected by COVID-19.</li>
                <br>
                <li>All irrelevant columns were dropped from both datasets. Some of the irrelevant columns include 'new_cases_smoothed', 'new_deaths_smoothed', 
                    and 'source_name'. The smoothed data was not particularly useful for the goals of this project, as were the source names from where the 
                    vaccination data was found.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The 'date' column for both datasets was converted to a datetime variable. This conversion was useful when creating the visualization on the 
                    vaccinations page that shows vaccination and case progression over time. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Overall Conclusions</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Analysis of infections data concludes that on a raw scale, <strong>the United States has suffered the most from COVID-19</strong>. With over 31 million cases and 570,000 deaths, The US
            has the highest numbers in these two categories in the world. Diabetes prevalence is perhaps the most measurable factor in assessing why US cases and deaths are so high;
            over 10% of the population in the US aged 20 to 79 have diabetes, which puts victims at a higher risk of death from COVID. However, on scale that takes cases and deaths 
            in proportion to population, Andorra has suffered the most cases-wise (16% of population), while Hungary suffered the most deaths-wise (0.269% of population). Andorra has 
            a sufficiently high prevalence of diabetes and smokers, while Hungary has a high median age and diabetes prevalence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Analysis of vaccination data concludes that <strong>Gibralter will likely gain full population immunity first</strong>. Despite Bhutan's larger percentage of population vaccinated per day (3.8% to 
            Gibralter's 2.1%), Gibralter has already vaccinated 93% of their population to date. Although the US and India are vaccinating a huge number of people per day (1 million+), in 
            proportion to their populations these values are miniscule. The most common factors associated with vaccination rates are GDP and human development index (HDI). High GDP and HDI 
            values mean more money to afford doses of different vaccines. As was the case with infections data, smaller countries are typically filling the top-ten lists. This is more or less 
            expected, since smaller countries that do not have appropriate resources will typically be unequipped to deal with outbreaks of disease. However, some smaller countries are in a 
            much wealthier stance and can afford to take care of themselves.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            However, perhaps the most important conclusion of this project is that certain factors cannot be measured. The outbreak of COVID-19 started in China, and yet China, with a population of 
            over a billion boasts a mere 100,000 cases and 4,000 deaths? I find this extremely hard to believe, despite their proportionately high average stringency index (~60.00). There have also 
            been reports of hospitals in the US gaining some sort of incentive for reporting COVID-19 cases; this could heavily skew case numbers as well. Combining untrustworthy reporting with the 
            prevalence of anti-maskers and conspiracy theorists can result in statistics that are hard to believe.
